                <p>
                    This website is made with ReactJs and Typescript. All the animations and transitions are purely made using css (css modules to be more precise). This was a conscious choice as I wanted to practice and highlight my proficiency with vanilla html and css.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did use some react features like useState and useRef to make it a bit more responsive and plan to expand the site using more React functionalities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website also has demos for some other projects that I have made in my free time to demonstrate how some of them work. So do check them out in the projects section!
                </p>
            </div>

            title: "ReactJs",
            body: <div>
                <p>
                    I had a great time learning ReactJs in college since a friend told me about it!</p>
                <p>
                    It was the first Javascript framework I learned and gave me a lot of trouble with state at first but eventually I got the hang of it.</p>
                <p>
                    It has come a long way with functional components since I started and I have kept up with the new changes in the framework and also Javascript in general.
                </p>
            </div>
        },
        {
            title: "Rust",
            body: <div>
                <p>
                    My journey with rust started recently as I was looking for a new language to refresh my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was interested to learn it since it was the most loved language according to stack overflow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It took me a little while to understand the concepts but in the end it helped me understand low level programming concepts and helped improve my understanding of coding in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an amazing language with a lot to offer to those who take the time to understand it (me). It does leave you wishing that other languages had these features.
                </p>
            </div>
        },
        {
            title: "Flutter",
            body: <div>
                <p>
                    Flutter was my go to framework for making any kind of front end for about 2 years from 2020 to 2022
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is really intuitive and after spending some time with it I feel pretty confident in making applications for any device with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infact one of the projects listed on the project page (Helix) has been my go to application for writing some songs in my free time.
                    I made it tailored to my own requirements using flutter and firebase.
                </p>
            </div>

            title: "ChatGPT",
            body: <div>
                <p>
                    I don't really use it since it's launch. But I see the potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe after it matures a little it will be more useful to my work.
                </p>
            </div>

            title: "Future Scope",
            body: <div>
                <p>
                    Adding more cool features to this website and maybe making a dedicated backend just for this website will be coming in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I might use this website as an outlet for my thoughts i.e. a blog section might come to the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A section for advice or a contact section where people can send me messages directly will be added.
                    Might configure an smtp server for that. Maybe it's already in the works ðŸ˜‰
